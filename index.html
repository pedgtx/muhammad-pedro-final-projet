          In 1905, as an unknown young physicist, employed at the Bern Patent Office, he published his theory<br>
          of special relativity. In it he incorporated, in a simple theoretical framework based on simple physical<br>
          postulates, concepts and phenomena previously studied by Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz. As a logical<br>
          consequence of this theory, he deduced the most popularly known physics equation: the mass-energy equivalence,<br>
          E = mc². That year, he published other works that would lay some of the foundations for statistical physics<br>
          and quantum mechanics.<br>
